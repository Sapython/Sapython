# Description
###### It is my personal portfolio with integration to firebase and google cloud to showcase my blogs, services and products. Anyone can buy my service directly from the website. This website has two parts one part is Admin Panel and another is Customer Panel. Customer Panel is what you can see if you have regular permission to website. But admins like me can also experience the other part of website which is Admin Panel. From where I can add new blogs, products and edit them. It is also integrated to my youtube channel. That's it.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
